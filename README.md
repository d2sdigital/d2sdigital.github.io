## It's time to release your data.

### WHAT WE DO

d2s Digital Limited provides services and products to enable you to 'do more' with your data. We offer a range of web enabled applications underpinned by APIs of your data, that can be run on-premises or in the cloud.

d2s Digital Limited also provides consultancy services, around digital transformation, cloud integration and bespoke development.  The use of Open-Source technologies is at the heart of d2s Digital Limited which enables us to provide you with value for money and to rapidly develop applications and services.

### SERVICES
We can provide you with a range of bespoke developed solutions tailored to your requirements but we can also provide you with simple, no frills, impartial consultancy on your data and digital requirements. Over the years we've see a lot of solutions, products and heard a lot of 'spiel', so although it might not always be us that can deliver for you, we probably know who can. We like to think we are different. So let's talk ?

### AT THE CORE                          
Application Program Interfaces: APIs are central to our products and services.
The growth of cloud services and infrastructure has changed the IT landscape, as such the power, flexibility and ease of accessibility of APIs is becoming more apparent. We believe in API-led connectivity to make data accessible to wider audiences through new, agile, better connected applications.  What API-led connectivity means for legacy systems and solutions is that the wealth of data, information and knowledge stored within it can be disseminated beyond the confines of a single application.
